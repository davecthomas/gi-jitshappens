      <title>Common Sense on Training</title>

      <description>For Students  Life isn&amp;rsquo;t fair; distinguish yourself with intense training. Remember when your coach told you size and strength don&amp;rsquo;t matter? He was wrong: strength matters. When all else is equal between opponents, whoever has the edge in the smallest way will distinguish themselves in victory. Oh, and size matters too. A big guy with like skills will crush a little guy. Sorry little guys. Coming from a featherweight, I share your pain.</description>

      <title>The Bane of Freedom</title>

      <description>A warning about instructors who put themselves before you. Many instructors treat their knowledge as a treasure that is only bestowed upon those in their inner circle: their most trusted students who have shown loyalty, their knights. All the other students are serfs who have not yet proven their worth to the king. All live within his kingdom. No bonds are made or allowed with other neighboring kingdoms. You can join the king, but you must move within the walls, and never leave again.</description>

      <title>Free Will and the Free Agent</title>

      <description>Student Migration and the Search for Personal Growth Treating students as the property of a school or coach demonstrates a lack of understanding of free will.
People who train in any sport or martial art are free agents. They should continue to move from training gym to gym until they find a place that suits their needs. Their needs will change over time as they make decisions about what they need to develop, and as they gain skills.</description>

      <title>Man Does Not Live By Theory Alone</title>

      <description>Survival requires much more than irregular and brief seminar training, books, and videotapes. The only knowledge that provides instantaneous recall in an attack situation is reflexive, or muscle memory. This comes with intense, repetitive, long-term training in proper technique with proper coaching. Seminars, books, and videotapes are great to augment regular training.
&amp;ldquo;Trust your instincts&amp;rdquo; means let your reflexive response lead you. Don&amp;rsquo;t hobble yourself with thought. An interesting test of this is if you ask someone the question &amp;ldquo;what would you do if someone came up to you and [insert violent attack here]?</description>

      <title>Martial Arts Training is Like Swiss Cheese</title>

      <description>While it&amp;rsquo;s cool and somewhat self-indulgent to say I spent 9 years getting 2 black belts in Karate, in reality it&amp;rsquo;s kind of like having a PhD. It looks really good on the wall and it&amp;rsquo;s a great conversation starter, but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t really mean much on the streets. I have grown much more in training in different arts for shorter timeframes (say, 2 to 6 years). Why? Because no martial art is perfect.</description>
